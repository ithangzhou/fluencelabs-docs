# Why Fluence?

互联网由少数科技巨头主导，他们控制着用户数据和基础设施。“数据极权主义者”的立场允许他们使用和滥用个人用户数据，同时也威胁到单点故障的业务连续性以及轻易关闭整个软件生态系统的能力。这种集中式数据所有权是单点故障，很容易成为审查和政府操纵的目标。

The internet is dominated by a handful of tech giants who control both user data and infrastructure. The position of "data totalitarians" allows them to use and misuse personal user data while also threatening businesses continuity with single points of failure and the ability to simply turn off entire software ecosystems. Such centralized data ownership presents a single point of failure and an easy target for censorship and government manipulation.

互联网基础设施的可信中立性对于改变现状至关重要。去中心化模式在设计上是中立的，因为它们没有集中的所有权或控制权，并且像真正的民主系统一样运作。他们的设计架构使参与者几乎不可能控制系统，因为其他参与者的激励措施阻止了这种情况的发生。

Credible neutrality of internet infrastructure is crucial for changing the status quo. Decentralized models are neutral by design as they do not have centralized ownership or control and operate like truly democratic systems. Their design architecture makes it nearly impossible for a participant to take control of the system as the incentives of other participants prevent this from happening.

Fluence是一个开放的、分布式的、点对点的协议，被设计为可信的中立性，并支持以下功能：

Fluence is an open, distributed, peer-to-peer protocol, designed to be credibly neutral and enables the following features:

## 无需许可

与HTTP等互联网协议类似，Fluence协议对谁可以作为提供者加入以及谁可以成为客户没有限制。进入计算市场或从市场租用资源无需批准、KYC 或类似程序。对硬件性能、位置或所有权没有要求。

Similar to internet protocols such as HTTP, the Fluence protocol applies no limitations on who can join as providers and who can be a customer. There is no approval, KYC, or similar procedure to enter the compute marketplace or rent resources from the marketplace. There are no requirements for hardware performance, location, or ownership.

## 抗审查

没有办法审查谁在使用Fluence或在Fluence上执行什么。客户和提供商使用该协议来发现彼此并执行工作。如果提供商受到当地监管机构的限制，他们可以自由过滤他们正在执行的内容，但由于客户不会被锁定在特定的提供商中，因此总有一些选项可以满足客户的标准。

There is no way to censor who uses Fluence or what is being executed on Fluence. Customers and providers use the protocol to find each other and perform the work. Providers are free to filter what they are executing if they are restricted by local regulators, but as customers are not locked into a particular provider, there are always options to meet a customer’s criteria.

## 信任最小化

Fluence网络运行在Aqua协议上，该协议确保了加密安全性，所有应用程序请求的身份验证，并为每次执行增加了证明和可审计性。这大大减少了对供应商良好声誉、品牌或声誉的依赖。客户现在只需信任该协议，而不是特定的提供商。

The Fluence network runs on the Aqua protocol, which ensures cryptographic security, authentication of all application requests, and adds proofs and auditability for every execution. This dramatically decreases the reliance on provider good name, brand, or reputation. Customers now trust the protocol and not a particular provider.


## 集体所有制

Fluence网络由Fluence DAO管理，任何Fluence代币持有者都可以参与其中。DAO 管理协议开发、更新和分配来自国库的资金，以增强和发展网络。Fluence由其社区集体管理，而不是由传统的公司结构管理。

The Fluence network is governed by the Fluence DAO in which any Fluence token holder may participate. The DAO manages the protocol development, updates, and distributes funds from the treasury to enhance and grow the network. Fluence is managed collectively by its community and not by a traditional company structure.
